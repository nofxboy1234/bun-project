## Project Overview

This is a full-stack task management application built with [Bun](https://bun.com/). It uses React with [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/) for routing and [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/) for data fetching and state management. The backend is a simple REST API built using Bun's built-in `serve` function.

The application allows users to view a list of tasks, view a single task, create new tasks, and delete tasks.

## Building and Running

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

To start the development server with hot reloading, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
bun build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized production build.

To run the production server, use:

```bash
bun start
```

## Development Conventions

### Code Style

The project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.

To format the code, run:

```bash
bun format
```

To lint the code, run:

```bash
bun lint
```

### Routing

The project uses file-based routing with TanStack Router. The routes are defined in the `src/routes` directory. The `routeTree.gen.ts` file is automatically generated by `@tanstack/router-cli`.

### State Management

The project uses TanStack Query for managing server state. The query options are defined in `src/tasksQueryOptions.tsx` and `src/taskQueryOptions.tsx`.

### API

The backend API is defined in `src/index.tsx`. It provides the following endpoints:

*   `GET /api/tasks`: Get all tasks.
*   `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
*   `GET /api/tasks/:id`: Get a single task by ID.
*   `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`: Update a task by ID.
*   `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a task by ID.
